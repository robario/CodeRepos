NAME
    JSONHttpRequest - Extend JSONScriptRequest to look like XMLHttpRequest
    more.

SYNOPSIS
      var req = new JSONHttpRequest();
      req.open('GET', 'http://www.example.com/jsonp');
      req.onreadystatechange = function() {
          if (req.readyState == 4 && req.readyState == 201) {
              alert(req.responseJSON);
          }
      };
      req.send(null);

DESCRIPTION
    JSONHttpRequest is more similar to XMLHttpRequest than
    JSONScriptRequest. It can treat the request headers, the response
    status, and the response headers. However, you have to enhance the
    server side to follow to it.

  Constructor
   JSONHttpRequest({...})
    The same argument as JSONScriptRequest can be specified.
